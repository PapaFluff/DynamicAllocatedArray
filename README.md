# DynamicAllocatedArray
In this assignment all functions must create and return a pointer to a dynamically allocated array.   Reverse Array Write a function that accepts an int array and the array’s size as arguments. The function should create a copy of the array, except that the element values should be reversed in the copy. The function should return a pointer to the new array.  Array Expander Write a function that accepts an int array and the array’s size as arguments. The function should create a new array that is twice the size of the argument array. The function should copy the contents of the argument array to the new array and initialize the unused elements of the second array with 0. The function should return a pointer to the new array.   Element Shifter Write a function that accepts an int array and the array’s size as arguments. The function should create a new array that is one element larger than the argument array. The first element of the new array should be set to zero. Element 0 of the argument array should be copied to element 1 of the new array, element 1 of the argument array should be copied to element 2 of the new array, and so forth. The function should return a pointer to the new array.
